<h2>More <i>'You Can't Win'</i> Research</h2>
<p>
	After finishing my article
	<i><a href="/blog/The_Identity_of_The_Sanctimonious_Kid.html" target="_blank">
		'The Identity of The Sanctimonious Kid'
	</a></i>, 
	I couldn't help but wonder if there was still more information out there to be found.
	There were still a few loose ends that needed tying up, 
	and a few promising leads to follow.
	I've found myself drawn back into Jack Black's world,
	searching through historic newspapers clippings for clues about the fate of the <i>'Sanctimonious Kid'</i>,
	and the characters who rode the rails with him in search of adventure and fortune.
	There are still a few escapees from Canon City prison to investigate,
	and a wealth of newspapers to search for clues about Black's other adventures.
	Eventually, if we're lucky, this might lead to another article.
</p>
<p>
	If you'd like to help with this research, please get in touch!
	Research is very time consuming,
	and working with the various state archives can be slow and difficult from outside of the United States.
	Any help on this project would definitely be appreciated.

<h2>Operating System Development in Ada</h2>
<p>
	I've been doing a lot of work on my hobby operating system projects in Ada.
	I've been teaching myself about microkernels, 
	and researching what kind of novel ideas might feature in next-generation kernels.
</p>
<p>
	I also intend to update the <i>'Ada Bare Bones'</i> tutorial on the
	<a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">osdev.org</a> 
	wiki to use 
	<a href="https://alire.ada.dev" target="_blank">Alire</a>.
</p>

<h2>Random Article Ideas</h2>
<p>
	I have lots of ideas, but unfortunately not enough time to write about them all.
	Here's a few random article ideas I've jotted down in my notepad,
	in no particular order:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Using Theorem Provers to Validate MMORPG Game Mechanics</li>
	<li>The Benefits of Non-commercial Software Licensing</li>
	<li>Parallelism Is a Better Semantic Model Than Async/Await</li>
	<li>Yamaha's RCM Synthesis</li>
	<li>Building a better PHP</li>
	<li>The Impact of Generative AI on Arts and Culture</li>
	<li>
		Interesting Features of the VAX/VMS Filesystem
		(Inspired by 
		<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32604842" target="_blank">this comment</a> 
		on Hacker News)</a>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Some of these article ideas are more developed than others.
	I can't make any promises about finishing any of these articles,
	but if you'd particularly like me to work on them, please let me know!
