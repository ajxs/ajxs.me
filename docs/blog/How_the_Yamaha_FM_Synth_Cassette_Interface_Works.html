          Prior to the personal computer becoming the centrepiece of home music
          production, backing up and storing synthesiser patches was a
          non-trivial problem. Synth manufacturers experimented with various
          interesting methods over the years, however none of these has aged
          more poorly than digital cassette storage.

          The years leading up to the DX7's groundbreaking 1983 release were a
          period of rapid, exciting innovation. The digital revolution had
          kicked into high gear, and technology was rapidly reshaping the world.

          Despite the rapid pace technology was advancing, disk drives were
          still complicated, expensive devices. Putting a disk drive into a
          synth required lots of extra circuitry, driving up costs and
          introducing new modes of failure. Considering this, it's not
          surprising that synth manufacturers opted for cheaper alternatives<sup

          Fortunately, the home computing world had already found a cheap and
          reliable solution for data storage:
          <i>Compact audio cassette tape</i>. It's unclear where exactly this
          innovation

            >originated</a
          >, but by the late-1970s the use of cassette interfaces in home
          computers had become commonplace; with the first IBM
          <i>PC</i> &#8212;released in 1981&#8212; featuring one. It shouldn't
          come as much of a surprise then, that as synthesisers started to
          become digital devices they would opt for the same solutions. Many of
          the flagship synths of the 80s' would feature cassette interfaces,
          such as the Oberheim OB-X, Sequential Circuits Prophet 5, and the
          Roland Jupiter 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DX9, released together with the DX7 in 1983, would be the first of
          Yamaha's FM synthesisers to feature a cassette interface<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_4" id="footnote_4_link">4</a></sup
          >. This interface consisted of three 1/8" cable sockets to connect to
          the headphone, microphone, and

          sockets of a consumer-grade cassette recorder. Later synths in
          Yamaha's FM line &#8212;such as 1989's TX81Z&#8212; would use an
          <a

          >
          for the cassette interface, coupled with a proprietary cable
          terminating in three 1/8" jacks; This 8-pin DIN socket format was
          shared with the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX" target="_blank">MSX</a>
          computer cassette interface, which is not surprising given Yamaha's
          involvement in its development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to distribute patches over an electronic medium opened up
          new possibilities for talented programmers: In the wake of the DX7, a
          new market emerged for patches for Yamaha's notoriously hard to
          program FM synths; with companies selling their patches on cartridges
          and cassette tape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protecting this new form of intellectual property was serious
          business, with professional DX7 patch authors reportedly going so far
          as embedding garbage information in their patch data to identify patch
          thieves after the fact, such as unique key scaling in unused
          operators, or invalid ASCII characters in a patch name<sup

          The audio signal begins with an extended 2400Hz 'pilot tone', which
          can be used to calibrate the volume of the input source. What follows
          is a sequence of data frames, each containing a single byte. Multiple
          data items (such as multiple patches, performances, etc) can be
          encoded in a single recording, separated by arbitrary lengths of the
          pilot tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          A binary '1' bit (known as a <i>'mark'</i>) is encoded with two
          'cycles' at 2400Hz. A '0' (known as a <i>'space'</i>) is encoded as a
          single cycle at 1200hz. A data packet, occupying roughly 9.1
          milliseconds of tape, consists of a leading zero bit indicating the
          start of a data frame, followed by the actual 8 data bits, LSB first.
          Two trailing 'ones' indicate the end of the data frame.

        </h2>
        <p>
          The technical implementation of the cassette interface in Yamaha's FM
          synthesisers is surprisingly simple: The raw electrical audio signal
          played from the cassette can be interpreted as binary data by the
          CPU's I/O ports, without requiring any analog to digital conversion.
          Sampling the positive peak of the audio wave period from the I/O port
          will be perceived by the CPU as a binary one, with a sample of
          negative voltage perceived as a zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, pulling an output I/O port's signal high, and low in quick
          succession will be recorded as a sinusoidal oscillation when sampled
          as audio by a tape recorder. By controlling the frequency of toggling
          the output voltage in the software, it is possible to create the
          encoded data output directly from the CPU, without requiring any
          additional, specialised circuitry.
        </p>
        <p>
          By periodically sampling the I/O pin connected to the cassette
          interface's input port, it's possible to determine the frequency of
          the incoming audio by counting the number of times the polarity of the
          signal changes within an arbitrary period.
        </p>
        <p>
          To accomplish this the synth firmware samples the cassette input I/O
          port at a set interval corresponding to the baud rate. The firmware
          controls this interval using an arbitrary delay routine, called
          between each sampling of the input port. Each successive sample is
          tested against the last using a XOR instruction, incrementing the
          'polarity change count' if the values differ. The number of polarity
          changes within a period will indicate whether the period's frequency
          was 2400hz indicating a '1' bit, or 1200hz for '0'. From this
          information it is possible to construct the full byte.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Yamaha FM synths use an interesting trick to construct the final
          value using the Hitachi HD6303 architecture's logical rotate
          instructions: Given that the number of polarity changes counted in a
          period will either be less than two in the case of a '0' bit, or more
          than two in the case of a '1' (binary <code>0b10</code>, or above), if
          the resulting pulse count is logically rotated twice rightwards the
          processor's carry flag will be set in the case that the input value is
          a '1'. With the result of the last bit read stored in the processor's
          carry flag, the result is then rotated rightwards into the
          most-significant bit of the result byte. Since each byte is encoded
          LSB first, after 8 iterations of this routine the final result byte
          will have been decoded. This same method of constructing the final
          byte is used in the cassette interface code in the DX9, DX100, and
          TX81Z firmware, with only minor variations.

            It's hard to say why Yamaha opted for a cassette interface over the
            voice cartridge system featured in the DX7. Yamaha clearly didn't
            consider either medium technically superior to the other. Both were
            used in their subsequent DX/TX series synthesisers. The DX7II, and
            TX802 &#8212;released in 1986, and 1987 respectively&#8212; would
            both feature a cartridge interface, whereas every other would have a
