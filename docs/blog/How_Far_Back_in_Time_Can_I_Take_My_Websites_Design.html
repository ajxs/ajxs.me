          They say that a builder's home is never finished. This saying is
          certainly true of the website you're reading right now. All too often
          I find myself tweaking the padding of list elements, carefully
          calibrating the ratios between heading sizes, or painstakingly fussing
          over the contrast between different shades of green. All in an effort
          to make the site more
          <i>'readable'</i>. After all, I don't want the task of reading this
          blog to any more painful for my dear readers than it needs to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this pursuit of 'readability', I've done my best to keep the site's
          design as straightforward as I can make it<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_1" id="footnote_1_link">1</a></sup
          >. The content is squeezed into a single column as wide as the eyes
          can comfortably scan. There are no complex sidebars, calendars, or tag
          clouds cluttering up the layout, and the colour palette is chosen to
          minimise eye strain when reading in a darkened room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently I read
          <a
            href="https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/"
            target="_blank"
            >this great article</a
          >
          from interface designer Anthony Hobday, in which he lays out a list of
          easy to follow visual design rules that even a design-challenged
          technical person like myself can understand. I <s>blame</s> credit
          this article for inspiring me to (yet again) roll up my sleeves and
          get stuck into this blog's design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between pruning container <i>divs</i> and removing collapsed margins
          the thought occurred to me that my site &#8212;with its
          <a href="https://brutalist-web.design" target="_blank">spartan</a>
          design and low-tech philosophy&#8212; could have remained pretty much
          identical since the internet's early days. This raised an interesting
          question:
          <i
            >Exactly how far back in time could my site's design have remained
            the same?</i
          >
          How far in the past could this site's current design have originated?
          5 years? 10 years? more?
        </p>
        <p>
          The only thing to do now would be to put this strange idea to the
          test. What follows is a tedious account of my trial and error doing
          just that.

          A Few Ground Rules <a class="permalink" href="#rules">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>Before I begin, I should establish a few rules...</p>
        <p>
          The challenge is to amend the markup so the site &#8212;as it looks
          now&#8212; works on
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_web_browsers"
            target="_blank"
            >browsers from the past</a
          >, <em>not</em> to come up with a good design that worked back then
          and now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site needs to <em>look</em> more or less identical to the
          <em>current</em> design, on both contemporary, <em>and</em> modern
          browsers. It would be no good after all if I managed to make my site
          display correctly on antiquated browsers, only to have my dear modern
          audience (you) suffer for it today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there are some things I know will just never work no matter
          how much effort is applied, so I'm willing to make a few small
          compromises here and there, as long as the design of the site remains
          more-or-less identical.
        </p>
        <p>
          My site doesn't use any Javascript. For this reason I've decided not
          to consider any solutions using Javascript trickery to resolve
          compatibility issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the rules established, there was nothing left to do but jump
          right in. I'll dial the clock back five years at a time, documenting
          the difficulties as I go. Without any further ado, let's take a walk
          down memory lane...
        </p>

        <h2 id="2008">

        </h2>
        <p>
          As it turns out, we have to dial the clock back 15 years before
          anything interesting starts happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          The year is 2008. Google have just released the beta of their new
          <i>Chrome</i> browser, and a much less cynical world is excited at the
          prospect of <i>anything but Microsoft</i>. Stack Overflow has just
          launched, and YouTube still looks like
          <a
            href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/timeline/youtube-2008"
            target="_blank"
            >this</a
          >. The cutting edge browsers on the market are Internet Explorer 7.0
          and Firefox 3.0. AOL had very recently
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131105081418/http://blog.netscape.com/2007/12/28/end-of-support-for-netscape-web-browsers/"
            target="_blank"
            >announced</a
          >
          that they would be ending all support for the ailing Netscape
          Navigator, giving their users an endorsement of Firefox as a parting
          gift.
        </p>

        <h3>Firefox 3.0</h3>
        <p>
          For what it's worth, I was an early Firefox adopter, and had already
          been a faithful user for several years by this point. While it
          <a
            href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/a-fun-list-of-browsers-youve-never-heard-of/"
            target="_blank"
            >wasn't the first</a
          >
          browser to feature a tabbed interface, Firefox's reintroduction of
          tabs to the new generation of web browsers was an absolute game
          changer.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Content Container Styling</h4>
        <a
          href="/static/articles/web_browser_history/2008/Firefox_3/Rem_Styling.jpg"
          target="_blank"

          <img
            src="/static/articles/web_browser_history/2008/Firefox_3/Rem_Styling_Thumbnail.jpg"
            alt="An image showing the blog index page with the entries stretched to the full width of the page"
          />
        </a>
        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          The cause of these layout problems didn't take long to track down: The
          <i>'rem'</i> unit wasn't even part of the CSS standard in 2008. After
          converting them to <i>'px'</i> with some crude 'Find+Replace'
          wizardry, things were starting to take shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Funnily enough, even though no styling was actually applied to the
          blog item headings, the browsers falling back to their default heading
          styles made the page largely resemble its intended design. I guess my
          pedantic adherence to semantic markup might actually pay dividends
          after all.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Mangled Page Header</h4>
        <a
          href="/static/articles/web_browser_history/2008/Firefox_3/Mangled_Headers.jpg"
          target="_blank"

          <img

            alt="An image showing the page header distorted"
          />
        </a>
        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          This turned out to be the result of Firefox applying a default
          <i>inline</i> style to the unsupported HTML5
          <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element.
        </p>
        <p>
          How browsers should, or even do actually handle unknown HTML elements
          is a matter of serious conjecture in the web design community. Reading
          the <em>actual</em> WHATWG
          <a
            href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#tree-construction"
            target="_blank"
            >specification</a
          >
          for how this should work isn't for the faint of heart either.
          Understanding the standard wouldn't help us much at any rate, as the
          first browsers to support these rules would actually be Firefox 4.0,
          and Internet Explorer 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, Mark Pilgrim's fantastic
          <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info" target="_blank"
            >Dive Into HTML5</a
          >

            target="_blank"

          >
          to how this actually works in practice across different browsers.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: &lt;figure&gt; elements not styled correctly</h4>
        <a
          href="/static/articles/web_browser_history/2008/Firefox_3/Figure_Tag.jpg"
          target="_blank"

          <img

            alt="An image showing figure elements not displaying correctly as block elements"
          />
        </a>
        <b>Status: Unresolved</b>
        <p>
          The <i>&lt;figure&gt;</i> elements I had used in several articles were
          not rendering correctly either for the same reason as the difficulties
          I experienced above with the page header.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the individual entries in this blog is composed in plain HTML
          and stored in an SQLite database, before being rendered into the final
          product by my homegrown
          <a href="https://github.com/ajxs/ajxs.me" target="_blank"
            >static-site generator</a
          >. Rather than removing the <i>&lt;figure&gt;</i>
          tags from each individual article, I decided that I would just have to
          live with this problem and move on.
        </p>

        <h3>Internet Explorer 7</h3>
        <p>
          Switching back to Internet Explorer, it was clear much more work
          needed to be done.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Blog Index Styling</h4>
        <a

          />
        </a>
        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          At first I suspected there was no way IE7 supported the 'child
          combinator' CSS selector I was using to style the blog index's
          entries. It turned out I was underestimating Internet Explorer's CSS
          support. A mistake I'd make more than once writing this article.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a quick session of <s>debugging</s> trial and error I figured
          out this was another instance of the browser not recognising HTML5's
          futuristic <i>semantic markup</i> elements. As Mark Pilgrim's
          <i>'Dive Into HTML5'</i> guide notes, when encountering an unknown
          HTML element Internet Explorer not only doesn't apply any styling to
          it, it doesn't apply styling to any of its descendants either!
        </p>
        <p>
          Changing the <i>&lt;section&gt;</i>, and <i>&lt;article&gt;</i> tags
          back into plain old <i>&lt;div&gt;</i> elements resolved these issues.
          Internet Explorer also added a default margins for lists, which I took
          the opportunity to reset.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Inline-Block List Elements</h4>
        <a

          />
        </a>
        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          'Inline-block' elements, such as the front page tag list, were being
          rendered as block. Between Firefox rendering block HTML5 elements
          inline, and IE rendering inline elements as block, it was all getting
          very confusing.
        </p>
        <p>

          hack as per

          from Mozilla resolved the issue. Somehow this doesn't seem to have any
          side-effects on other browsers, thankfully.

          function was breaking IE7's CSS parsing, causing it to stop applying
          any subsequent definitions from the stylesheet. Unsurprisingly, this
          caused a great load of other problems, like breaking the
          <i>TL;DR</i> block and code snippet styling.

          This function is used to create the item numbering in the 'Table of
          Contents' section used in articles. Unlike the native
          <code>list-style</code> property, using CSS counters allows creating
          numbering for the nested sub-lists, such as <i>2.1.1.</i>, and so
          forth.

          interesting article provides an extremely clever hack for implementing
          CSS numbering in early IE versions, however it seems fragile, and more
          work than it's worth. My options here seemed somewhat limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a lot of testing, it turns out that the
          <i
            ><a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/counter"

              >counter()</a
            ></i
          >
          function (As opposed to <em>counter<b>s</b></em
          >) doesn't actually cause the same issue. Unfortunately this doesn't
          get us any closer to actual numbering, as IE7 and below didn't even
          support the <code>::before</code>, and <code>::after</code> CSS
          pseudo-elements, or the <code>content</code> property used to place
          the numbering in the first place. This solution also doesn't allow for
          the <i>'recursive'</i> sub-list numbering on browsers that actually
          support counters, which was the whole point of using the function over
          the native list styling in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          After way too much messing around, I decided the best compromise was
          to revert to using the native <code>list-style</code> to number the
          Table of Contents items. This allowed for <em>some</em> numbering in
          both IE7, <em>and</em> other browsers. I apologise to anyone still
          suffering through this article.

          As if just to heap insult upon injury, the CSS
          <code>outline</code> property

            >isn't supported</a

          in IE7 either, so my stylish double-border isn't going to show up
          either. I guess I'll just have to live without that one. Surprisingly,
          CSS counters were actually

            >supported</a

        <h3>Internet Explorer 6.0</h3>
        <p>
          After dialling the clock back a full 20 years, things really began to
          fall apart.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Main Page Styling</h4>
        <a
          href="/static/articles/web_browser_history/2003/Internet_Explorer_6/Styles.jpg"
          target="_blank"

            alt="An image showing the entire page with no styles applied"
          />
        </a>
        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          At this point Internet Explorer 6 wasn't styling the front-page blog
          entries at all. I had a hunch, based on caniuse.com's suggestion, that
          this could be due to IE lacking support for the
          <i>&lt;ul&gt;</i> element...
        </p>
        <p>
          It turned out that this time it <em>was</em> actually IE's lack of
          support for the child combinator CSS selector. This now meant that I
          needed to explicitly prevent the nested 'tagged as' lists from picking
          up the styling of the main blog index entries. No problem, I guess.
          However this caused an issue on modern browsers where the nested lists
          do not behave correctly when the main blog index item is hovered. To
          remedy this without using child combinators I had to make judicious
          use of the <code>background-color: unset;</code> property on the
          nested list items. I guess that this is the kind of thing that still
          inspires hate for CSS.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Index Entry Items Don't Highlight on Hover</h4>
        <b>Status: Unresolved</b>
        <p>
          Unfortunately IE6 doesn't support the <code>:hover</code> CSS selector
          on arbitrary elements, so the front-page index blog entry elements no
          longer highlight when hovered over. I'm sure this would be easily
          resolvable with Javascript, but since that's out of the question we'll
          unfortunately just have to push on without it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wrapping the entire index entry item in a link, and
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/nested-links/" target="_blank"
            >nesting</a
          >
          the tag links creates all kinds of chaos, so we won't be considering
          that either.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the previous link notes, it's definitely <i>possible</i> to use
          some CSS positioning trickery to make the links
          <em>appear</em> visually nested. This is just a little bit too hacky
          for me though. This kind of CSS layout <s>crime</s> wizardry was
          definitely a hallmark of early 2000s web design, with its ubiquitous
          <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_three_columns.asp"
            target="_blank"
            >three column layouts</a
          >
          precariously held together with the CSS equivalents of thumb-tacks and
          duct-tape. The Flexbox CSS layout method would eventually make this
          much more straightforward, but setting up a good vertical navbar in
          the 90s/00s was no laughing matter.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Transparent PNG Support</h4>
        <a
          href="/static/articles/web_browser_history/2003/Internet_Explorer_6/PNG.jpg"
          target="_blank"

          <img

            alt="An image showing the contact icons displaying without transparency"
          />
        </a>
        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          PNG transparency isn't supported in IE6. Unfortunately, there just
          wasn't anything else (reasonable) to do but convert the PNG images to
          transparent GIFs. Some quick <i>imagemagick</i> got the job done in no
          time, although the anti-aliasing effect of the PNG alpha channel is
          gone. I guess we can just make do like it's 2003 and live with that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being confronted with the ghastly results of my hasty solution brought
          back memories of tweaking GIF image palettes in Paint Shop Pro (back
          when it was still owned by Jasc). It was pretty much standard in those
          days for any respectable site to have a page-width banner image in
          their header, and &#8212;of course&#8212; optimising them was serious
          business. Contemporary experts advised web designers to set total page
          size budgets stretching into the hundreds of kilobytes, the lion's
          share of which was often totally superfluous banner imagery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully those days of bloated, image heavy layouts are long gone...
          Only to be replaced instead by hundreds of kilobytes of bloated
          Javascript frameworks and analytics libraries. This epidemic of
          overweight websites has steadily declined into what the brilliant
          Maciej Ceg&#322;owski has so aptly titled

          encouraging those of us in the developer community to put our designs

          quite make the cut for the latter, tipping the scales somewhere around

          Unfortunately, the issue I tackled above with the nested lists not
          picking up their parent list item's highlighted colour on hover was
          reoccurring in Netscape. The fix I used earlier of removing any
          implicit background colour didn't seem to accomplish anything here.
          Surprisingly, aside from this everything else was totally fine, so I
          was happy enough to write this one off and move on.

          To veterans of the browser wars, any mention of
          <i>'cross-browser compatibility issues'</i> brings to mind one culprit
          in particular: <em>Internet Explorer</em>.<br />
          I certainly remember burning the midnight oil painstakingly aligning

          actually have been the villain of browser history we all remember them
          to be. He lays out a very compelling argument that Microsoft actually
          adhered much more closely to the W3C's specifications than their
          competitors, and were arguably no worse corporate citizens than their
          contemporary rivals. I recommend everyone give this incredibly
          well-researched, eye-opening presentation a watch.

          Unfortunately the <code>max-width</code> CSS property of block

          specification in 2010. I remember how revolutionary this CSS property

          After trying a dozen different approaches in vain, I resorted to using
          an IE-specific stylesheet, imported using a
          <i>'Conditional Comment'</i> in the page's header. Prior to writing
          this article I had actually completely forgotten this functionality
          even existed. With any luck, I may forget again.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a few blog articles I'd used the HTML5
          <a
            href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element"
            target="_blank"
            >Figure</a
          >
          element to wrap captioned images. Attempting to select any
          <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element inside a
          <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element with CSS wasn't going to work. As
          mentioned earlier, Internet Explorer won't style any unknown elements
          or their children. Adding a rule to my new IE-only stylesheet to set a
          fixed width for any image inside the entry body somehow seemed to do
          the trick.
        </p>
        <p>
          Granted, this isn't really a <em>maximum</em> image width, but this
          patchy solution <em>does</em> solve the issue. As far as I'm aware all
          of the thumbnail images in my article are above the maximum image
          size, so no stretching will actually occur.

        <h3>Netscape Navigator 4.5</h3>
        <p>
          I can't remember how exactly I got introduced to the internet, but I
          do know that the first time I saw it was through a Netscape
          Navigator<sup><a href="#footnote_2" id="footnote_2_link">2</a></sup>
          window. While I am getting a bit long in the tooth now, I'm not
          <em>quite</em>
          old enough to have had to worry about Netscape's share of CSS issues.
          Now was my chance to catch up on all the fun I missed...
        </p>
        <p>
          For much of this section, I will be referring to

          The CSS3 Background module

            >"authors specify the background for the BODY element rather than
            the HTML element"</i
          >. Doing just that restored the page's lost background colour.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: List Items</h4>
        <a

        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          Now that we have a background colour again, it's plain to see that
          something is going really wrong with the front page blog index
          styling. It turns out Netscape doesn't like the way I constructed the
          main blog index out of a list element<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_3" id="footnote_3_link">3</a></sup
          >. Converting the individual index entry items from
          <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
          resolved the issue.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Background Only Applied To Text</h4>

        </a>
        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          Once again, I have RichInStyle.com to thank for a solution that may
          have taken me years to find on my own. Apparently this ghastly effect
          is the result of a bug in Netscape 4.x. Adding the
          <code>border: none</code> property to elements resolved this issue.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Body Font Color</h4>
        <a
          href="/static/articles/web_browser_history/1998/Netscape_Navigator_4_5/Body_Font.jpg"

          />
        </a>
        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          This problem was solved by explicitly adding the font colour property
          to all of the relevant elements, one tedious definition after another.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Centre Div</h4>
        <a
          href="/static/articles/web_browser_history/1998/Netscape_Navigator_4_5/Center_Div.jpg"
          target="_blank"

          <img
            src="/static/articles/web_browser_history/1998/Netscape_Navigator_4_5/Center_Div_Thumbnail.jpg"

        </a>
        <b>Status: Unresolved</b>
        <p>
          According to RichInStyle.com, <i>"Auto is interpreted as 0"</i>, so
          the modern solution of <code>margin: 0 auto</code> won't accomplish
          anything in Netscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a battle-scarred veteran of the browser wars, I recalled the old
          trick of combining an absolute position and a negative margin, such
          as:
          <code>position: absolute; left: 50%; margin-left: -320px;</code>
          However all this accomplished was pushing the centre column halfway
          off the page, as Netscape 4.5 doesn't seem to support negative
          margins.
          <a
            href="/static/articles/web_browser_history/1998/Netscape_Navigator_4_5/Center_Div_Misaligned.jpg"

            />
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          In desperation I even tried using Netscape's dreaded
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>&lt;center&gt;</code></a
          >
          tag, rendered erroneously in the <s>Queen's</s> King's English as
          <i>&lt;centre&gt;</i>. I may as well have left it that way for all the
          good it did me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grasping at straws, I tried adding the
          <code>align="center"</code> attribute, as suggested
          <a
            href="https://www4.cs.fau.de/Services/Doc/webdocs/webdocs/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/center.html"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >, to no avail. There's only so much time I'm willing to spend solving
          this particular problem. With heavy heart, and with my remaining
          patience quickly evaporating, I decided to let this one go.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem: Image Size</h4>

        </a>
        <b>Status: Solved</b>
        <p>
          Having barely mentally recovered from the last frustrating issue, I
          was willing to consider more <i>expedient</i> approaches to solving
          any further problems. I figured there was no need to complicate
          matters any further, so I manually resized the image files to their
          final, correct size. I'm not even sure why I hadn't done this already.
        </p>
        <p>
          To align the newly resized images correctly I resorted to using a
          <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element. Very naughty. The only way this
          could be any worse would be using transparent <i>'spacer'</i> images
          to nudge things around.

        <h3>NCSA Mosaic 1.2</h3>

          Laugh if you must, but I'm genuinely surprised that tracking down
          copies of the internet's earliest browsers is as hard as it was.

          The novelty of testing my site against Mosaic didn't take long to
          start wearing off. The whole problematic endeavour was complicated,
          not the least of which, by the fact that the Mosaic browser actually
          <em>predates</em>
          the HTTP 1.0 specification. Meaning that some modern webservers will
          have some trouble honouring its requests.

          in my Windows 98 VM was much less of a headache, but my conscience
          simply wouldn't permit me passing this off as the real deal. With my

        <p>
          For the sake of expediency, I ended up building <i>xmosaic</i> from
          the source available
          <a href="https://github.com/csev/xmosaic-1.2" target="_blank">here</a
          >. A few tweaks were needed for it to build on a modern Linux distro,
          but this didn't take too long. On account of being Mosaic for
          <i>X</i>, it takes its colour-scheme from
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ajxs/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/.Xresources"

          After quickly cobbling a new X colour-scheme together, I was ready for

          site rendering &#8212;in a reasonable fashion&#8212; in the Mosaic
          browser was absolutely doomed from the start. If for no other reason
          than the fact that, at this point, CSS wouldn't be created for

            >another three years</a

          technical trickery could ever make my site display correctly in
          Mosaic.

          Working backwards through the history of internet browsers, it's
          interesting to see how quickly the design of the
          <i>world-wide-web</i> crystallised into something we'd recognise today
          as the modern internet. And on that note, how little the
          <i>concept</i> has changed overall. While the complexity of online
          user-interfaces may have converged with that of traditional desktop
          applications, the original UI/UX paradigm of just
          <em>clicking on text</em> remains the dominant way of interacting with
          the web. A time traveller from 1993 would definitely be dazzled by a
          site like YouTube, Netflix, or Amazon, but beneath the all the rich
          and colourful

          Not the least among my many follies is a tragic sentimentality for the
          internet of my teenage years. A wistful nostalgia for a less cynical
          age of technological optimism. When the world-wide-web was the
          creative, secret domain of an emerging
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxbZq8Zmd88" target="_blank"
            >cyberpunk counterculture</a
          >. An era when artists<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_4" id="footnote_4_link">4</a></sup
          >, entrepreneurs, and activists alike were excited at the prospect of
          a technological future, ripe with the potential to empower mankind's
          finest qualities. Before the eternal September of the social media
          age, and before the Patriot Act, PRISM, or the emergent
          <i>'Big Tech'</i> oligarchy and its corporate panopticon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paradoxically, for many people the internet seemed a much bigger place
          when it was <em>smaller</em>. The <i>cyberspace</i> of the 90s/00s
          seemed like the private canvas of an entirely new kind of artist.
          Fertile ground where a generation of hackers could explore new,
          emergent forms of creativity. Where they could find a sense of
          belonging, interacting with highly personalised spaces designed by
          like-minded individuals the world over. Despite modern technology
          empowering more people than ever to access the internet, a growing
          number of users feel that the internet of today has stopped being a
          <em>personal</em> space at all. Rather than empowering users with a
          blank canvas for their imagination, today's internet has become a
          place where users are acted <em>upon</em>. Certainly no one would ever
          expect that <i>Googling</i> a particular topic would ever find them
          the personal, creative work of an <em>individual</em> anymore. Users
          have increasingly become accustomed to a <em>corporate</em> internet,
          consisting primarily of platforms seeking to commodify their
          attention, or monetise their interactions in increasingly
          exploitative, predatory ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not alone in feeling this way. A growing movement of online
          content creators is working to reclaim the feeling of a more personal,
          artisanal internet. A community of retro websites has blossomed around

            >new protocols</a
          >
          have been devised to recapture the feeling of the internet's earliest
          days. One name for this movement that I particularly like is
          <i>'The Small Web'</i>, popularised by Parimal Satyal's wonderful

          This movement to recreate the small-web isn't just concerned with the
          web as an artistic medium, but also the philosophical, environmental,
          and political implications of an increasingly connected world. A
          growing concern for many is the increasing concentration of power in
          only a handful of online content platforms, and the emerging issue of
          <em>sovereignty</em> over their own data. Entire
          <a href="https://landchad.net/" target="_blank">communities</a> have
          sprung up dedicated to <i>self-hosting</i> their own infrastructure,
          and the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse" target="_blank"
            >federation</a
          >
          of these platforms. Concern about the increasing technological
          complexity of web design, and the internet as a whole, has driven a
          resurgence in simpler, 'static' sites and the use of
          <i>static-site generator</i> frameworks such as
          <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.

          In defence of my nostalgia, I was <em>there</em>.<br />
          Like so many other children of the 90s, I didn't need any convincing
          when it came to the internet, I just <em>got</em> it, and as soon as I
          realised I could create pages of my own, I wanted in. Somewhere in the
          middle of putting a primary-school assignment together I discovered
          that I could use <i>Microsoft Publisher 98</i> to build HTML pages.
          <em>Instantly</em> I was hooked. My family didn't even <i>have</i> the
          internet at home and yet there I was, designing a website of my very
          own. I had absolutely no idea how I'd actually get it online, but that
          didn't slow me down for a second. Eventually I'd move on to real
          <i>WYSIWYG</i> editors like Microsoft FrontPage, and ultimately
          Macromedia Dreamweaver after a family friend brought back an
          &#8212;obviously bootleg&#8212; copy of Macromedia's Studio MX from a
          business trip to Hong Kong. Ten years later I was still hooked, taking
          my first steps in the industry creating the first-generation of what
          we now call SPAs, using Actionscript in Adobe Flash. Twenty (plus)
          years later, I'm still here. While the web might have changed, I
          haven't. I still have the same excitement about technology that
          invigorated my childhood imagination, and still want to build webpages
          to tell the world all about it. Despite the internet gradually
          becoming a less-welcoming neighbourhood, I hope I can help inspire
          people in my own small way, and encourage others like myself to
          explore their creativity<sup

            This design asceticism extends beyond just the site's superficial
            qualities, it's austere also in its implementation: It has no
            analytics, collects no data, uses no Javascript, or features any
            dynamic content whatsoever. It's just a few kB of
            statically-generated HTML, CSS, and a few assorted icon images.

            It's worth noting that around this time, in March 1998, Netscape
            released the source code for the <i>Communicator</i> application
            suite. Although they would be disbanded in just a few short years,
            this code would secure Netscape's legacy, providing a foundation on
            which the <i>Firefox</i> browser would be built.

            I constructed the main blog index out of a <i>&lt;ul&gt;</i> element

              A decade ago, in an act of extreme futility, I wrote a book about
              HTML5. I did the mailing list archaeological dig to discover the
              logic behind these and other new (at the time) elements. There
              really wasn't any. The spec editor just made them up on a whim
              with very eccentric definitions. I found that very frustrating as
              I saw it as inflicting a whole array of meaningless choices on
              front end folks for years to come. A decade later, and folks are
              still earnestly trying to divine the wisdom of the spec. No need
              &#8212; there isn't any. There's no there there. I don't blame the
              author for trying, but I do blame the spec author for a very silly
              rabbit hole that people are still falling down to this day.
