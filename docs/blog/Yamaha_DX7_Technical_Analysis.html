        </h2>
        <p>
          In 1983 Yamaha Corporation released the now iconic DX7 synthesiser.
          Featuring a novel form of digital synthesis called
          <i>frequency modulation</i>, it would introduce musicians to a new
          world of sounds not previously possible with its analog
          contemporaries. Its characteristic brassy, metallic timbres would go
          on to define the sound of the decade. By all accounts it was
          revolutionary. It would go on to sell over 200,000 units worldwide,
          becoming the first commercially successful digital synthesiser.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>frequency modulation</i> synthesis that forms the basis of the
          DX7 had its origins in the research of Stanford University professor
          John M. Chowning. Inspired by the groundbreaking work of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Mathews" target="_blank"
            >Max Mathews</a
          >
          at Bell Labs, Chowning shifted his course of study from music
          composition to focus on computer music. While experimenting with
          modulating a sound wave's frequency, Chowning discovered that as the
          frequency of the modulating wave increased into the audible spectrum,
          interesting harmonic partials appeared in the carrier tone, while
          still retaining the original note's pitch. He quickly realised this
          technique opened up a new world of tonal possibilities that
          contemporary analog synthesisers simply couldn't match.
        </p>
        <p>
          The significance of Chowning's discovery was not lost on his
          colleagues, who urged him to patent this remarkable new technique<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_1" id="footnote_1_link">1</a></sup
          >. With the help of
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Moorer"
            target="_blank"
            >Andy Moorer</a
          >
          from Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Lab, Chowning would publish
          the groundbreaking paper
          <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23320142" target="_blank"
            ><i
              >The Synthesis of Complex Audio Spectra by Means of Frequency
              Modulation</i
            ></a
          >, and United States Patent No. 4,018,121.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mathematical terms, FM synthesis is achieved by using the
          instantaneous amplitude of a signal (the <i>modulator</i>) to adjust
          the frequency of another signal (the <i>carrier</i>). This might make
          more sense when visualised:

          There are many fantastic resources online that give a much better
          explanation of FM synthesis than I can.

          By the mid-1970s, Stanford's Office of technology and licensing had
          yet to successfully find a prospective licensee for their breakthrough
          among American music technology manufacturers<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_2" id="footnote_2_link">2</a></sup
          >. The investment required to pivot to digital technology was simply
          too big a financial risk to take for companies specialising in analog
          synthesisers. To find a licensee, Stanford would need to look abroad:
          Despite not having a significant market presence on American shores,
          Yamaha was at that time the largest manufacturer of musical
          instruments in the world. As fate would have it, one of their senior
          engineers &#8212;an expert in digital technology named Kazukiyo
          Ishimura&#8212; happened to be visiting their American branch at the
          time, apparently researching the very kind of integrated circuit
          technology that would make their future FM synthesis technology
          possible. He was willing to take a trip out to Stanford to hear
          Chowning's breakthrough for himself. In Chowning's own words:
          <i
            >"In ten minutes he understood; he knew exactly what I was talking
            about"</i
          >
          (Darter, 1985).
        </p>
        <p>
          Impressed with what they saw, Yamaha would go on to purchase an
          exclusive license to the technology from Stanford. The rest is
          history. For more information about Chowning and Yamaha's
          collaboration, a fantastic documentary on the history of the DX7's
          development can be seen

        </p>
        <p>
          Roland Corporation's founder Ikutar&#333; Kakehashi also met with
          Chowning to discuss his research. Unfortunately slightly too late to
          secure FM synthesis for Roland, with Stanford having signed an
          exclusive license with Yamaha only six months earlier. In his memoirs,
          Kakehashi admits that Yamaha were the right people for the job, given
          their capability to manufacture the LSI chips necessary to make the
          technology viable. (Kakehashi, 2002, pp. 194-195)
        </p>
        <p>
          Roland's technical R&amp;D director Tadao Kikumoto &#8212;himself no
          stranger to innovation, having been the inventor of the iconic
          TB-303&#8212; spent a year poring over Yamaha's technical literature
          looking for a way to implement an FM synth without running afoul of
          patent infringement<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_3" id="footnote_3_link">3</a></sup
          >, He would also invest considerable time searching high and low for
          prior art that would invalidate Yamaha's patent. A search that would
          ultimately not prove fruitful (Reiffenstein, 2004, pp. 275-276).
          However unsuccessful these efforts may have been, Roland's research in
          the area of digital synthesis would ultimately lead them to produce
          their own groundbreaking digital synth: The D50.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yamaha's approach to patenting their FM technology is by all accounts
          comprehensive. It's through these patents, service manuals, and the
          heroic reverse engineering efforts of some extremely talented
          engineers that we've been able to gleam what information we know of
          the DX7's internals.

          The beating heart of the DX7 is a Hitachi 63B03RP microprocessor, an
          enhanced version of Motorola's
          <a
            href="https://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/6800/index.html"

          of 8-bit CPUs, built under license as a second-source supplier<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_4" id="footnote_4_link">4</a></sup
          >. Clocked at around 1MHz, it provides the synthesiser a steady pulse,
          but not the kind of raw processing power required for real-time
          digital synthesis. The DX7's real capabilities lay inside two
          proprietary integrated circuits: the YM21280 FM-Operator Type S chip,
          otherwise known in Yamaha's technical literature as the <i>OPS</i>,
          and its counterpart the YM21290 Envelope Generator or <i>EGS</i>. As
          their names suggest, the OPS and EGS are responsible for operator and
          envelope generation respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know from the service manual that the OPS processes all 16
          six-operator voices in ~20.368032&#956;s. From this we can determine
          that the synth's overall sample rate is 49096Hz.
        </p>
        <p>
          MIDI I/O is handled by the synth's CPU, while the scanning of the
          DX7's analog input (keyboard, foot pedal, and panel switch events) is
          handled by a separate "sub-CPU", a Hitachi 6805S 8-bit processor. The
          sub-CPU communicates with the synth's analog peripherals via a
          multiplexed A/D converter, and transmits this data to the main CPU via
          one of its IO ports using a complex handshake mechanism described in
          detail in the service manual.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DX7's smaller desktop module cousin, the TX7, has an entirely
          different design. It features a different microprocessor, the Hitachi
          HD63A03, and does not include a sub-CPU. All input scanning is
          performed by the main processor. The TX7's service manual &#8212;an
          incredibly detailed source of technical information&#8212; provides a
          memory map for the CPU, as well as a flowchart of the serial interrupt
          routine, timer interrupt routine, and main executive loop. The DX7's
          budget-oriented counterpart, the
          <a

            >DX9</a
          >
          would also make do without the DX7's sub-CPU.

        <p>
          Each of the DX7's six operators consist of a digital sine wave
          oscillator, with its own independent envelope. In technical terms,
          these are known as <i>numerically controlled oscillators</i>: A
          <a href="https://www.gkbrk.com/wiki/PhaseAccumulator/" target="_blank"
            >phase accumulator</a
          >
          register is used to store an index into a lookup table of wave
          amplitude values stored in ROM. In this system the angular velocity of
          the oscillator's wave is controlled by incrementing the phase
          accumulator each sampling iteration with an amount proportional to the
          desired frequency. This implementation forms the basis of
          <i>Direct Digital Synthesis</i>, a technique used in a variety of
          different engineering disciplines.

            The above diagram illustrates the relationship between the phase
            accumulator register and the oscillator's sinusoidal output. 110hz,
            220hz and 440hz waves are synthesised by varying the gradient of the
            phase increment. The diagram demonstrates that the phase accumulator
            value resembles a modulo-2n sawtooth wave when plotted, where n is
            the resolution of the wave lookup table.

          The YM21280's pre-calculated sine wave lookup table is stored in
          logarithmic format. Using a novel mathematical trick known to anyone
          familiar with a slide-rule, storing the oscillator's wave data in
          logarithmic format allows for scaling the wave's amplitude without the
          need for multiplication<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_5" id="footnote_5_link">5</a></sup

          allows for replacing the multiplication of the wave's amplitude with
          the envelope gain with a relatively cheap addition operation. To
          convert the product of this calculation from logarithmic to linear
          format, the OPS stores a lookup table of exponential values.

          Taking full advantage of the sine wave's symmetrical property, the OPS

          decapsulation on the OPS chip verified that the quarter log-sine table
          consists of 1024 samples, with a fully assembled sine wave having

          FM sound-chip designed for use within PC sound-cards), and read the
          binary ROM data encoded in the chip's die. Their work provided much of

          Once the correct phase data has been calculated for each of the
          operators, the actual frequency modulation is performed. The
          sinusoidal output of one operator (described in the patent as
          <i>f(&#969;mt)</i>) is then used to modulate the phase angle<sup

          >. The service manual provides a surprisingly in-depth description of
          how data is stored in the OPS' internal registers during the synthesis
          process (considering that no datasheet for the EGS or OPS is publicly

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>
          The DX7's feedback mechanism is implemented by storing the result of
          processing an operator, and using it to modulate its own frequency
          over multiple iterations: The output amplitude of the last iteration
          is added to the phase accumulator value used as the input for the
          next. As the feedback iterations increase the sinusoidal operator
          output approaches the appearance of a sawtooth wave. For interested
          readers, US patent 4,249,447 contains a detailed description of the
          feedback synthesis process.

          The YM21290 (<i>EGS</i>) chip is the entry point of the DX7's tone
          synthesis process. It receives voice data from the synth's firmware,
          then generates the frequency and envelope amplitude data used by the
          YM21280 to generate the actual tone. We know from the service manual
          and schematics that this frequency data has a word-length of 14 bits,
          and that the amplitude has a word-length of 12 bits, and that these
          are sent to the OPS over a parallel interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to
          <a

          acclaimed Dexed emulator:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Through measurement, it's clear that the 12-bit envelope value is a
          simple Q8 fixed-point representation of logarithmic (base 2) gain.
          Linear gain is equal to 2^(value / 256). The steps are particularly
          clearly seen in plots of amplitude for slow-decaying envelopes. This
          gives a total of about 96dB of dynamic range, in steps of
          approximately 6 / 256 = .0234 dB, which is smooth to the ear."

        <h4>Phase Generator</h4>
        <p>
          The DX7's official technical literature does not go into great detail
          about the 'phase generator'. We know that the firmware converts a MIDI
          note number to a logarithmic representation of its frequency, which is
          combined with the pitch EG's current amplitude, the master tune
          setting, and any key transposition. This value is then written to the
          appropriate registers on the EGS chip. This logarithmic
          <i>frequency number</i> value is described in patent US4554857:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          It is known in the art that a frequency number expressed in logarithm
          can be obtained by frequently adding data of two low bits of the key
          code KC to lower bits... The key code KC is applied to the adder in
          the form of such frequency number expressed in logarithm. By adding
          the coefficient k to the logarithmically expressed frequency number
          (corresponding to the linearly expressed angle frequency &#969;), an
          operation equivalent to multiplication for obtaining a product
          "k&#969;" is performed. A frequency number generator 15 is constituted
          of a logarithm-linear converter converting the logarithmically
          expressed frequency number to the linearly expressed frequency number
          k&#969;.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In the DX7's firmware ROM, the conversion to the logarithmic format
          described above is performed by the subroutine located at offset
          <code>0xD7DF</code> in the synth's memory, (offset
          <code>0x17DF</code> relative to the start of the ROM file itself). In
          the annotated disassembly this subroutine is labeled as
          <code>VOICE_CONVERT_NOTE_TO_PITCH</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exact method by which the YM21290 calculates a given frequency's
          phase increment from this value is unknown<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_9" id="footnote_9_link">9</a></sup
          >, and without further experimentation (see afterword) it will likely
          remain so.
        </p>

        <h3 id="dac">DAC <a class="permalink" href="#dac">#</a></h3>
        <p>
          The DX7 uses a time-multiplexed DAC with two sample and hold circuits,
          which output the synth's 16 voices in two repeating time slices. This
          is done to maximise the dynamic range of the synth's output and limit
          intermodulation distortion between the different voices. You can see
          this for yourself by running the synthesiser's output through an
          oscilloscope.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actual digital-to-analog conversion is performed by a BA9221
          12-bit bipolar DAC chip. Like most of the DX7's electronics, the DAC
          communicates with the EGS over a parallel interface. Interestingly,
          the reference voltage of the DAC is not hard-wired. Instead it's
          controlled by a resistor ladder connected to an analog multiplexer
          (labelled as IC46 in the schematics), which is wired into the CPU's
          address bus. This effectively allows for 8 discrete volume levels
          controllable via software. This particular setup seems to vary widely
          between different synth implementations, with the TX7 and TX802 having
          different setups entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most interesting feature of the DX7's DAC is that the output of
          the aforementioned BA9221 is fed into another analog multiplexer
          (labelled as IC41 in the schematics), which functions as an
          exponential scaler for the DAC output. This effectively expands the
          resolution of the DAC to 15 bits. This analog multiplexer consists of
          a TC4066BP <i>quad bilateral switch</i> connected to an R-2R resistor
          ladder. This is described as the <i>amplitude scale factor</i> in the
          service manual, and is controlled via the SF0 ~ SF3 pins on the
          YM21280. This effectively converts the 12-bit linear DAC into what
          could be described as a 15-bit floating point DAC, with a 12-bit
          mantissa and 3-bit exponent. The TX7's service manual describes this
          functionality of this circuit in the following manner (corrections
          mine):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The output data of the OPS is 12-bit. However, to make this the
          equivalent of 14-bit [sic], the lower levels are expanded 2, 4, and 8
          times respectively. To return this to the original value, shift data
          (SF0~SF3) is sent out.<br /><br />

          The-12 bit digital data from the OPS is sent to the DAC IC24 and
          converted into an analog signal. This 12 bit digital data has been
          expanded inside the OPS, so the IC26 and the connected resistances
          will return it to the original level. This is controlled by the shift
          data sent from the OPS (SF<sub>0</sub> ~ SF<sub>3</sub>), which is
          sent at the same time as the 12 bit digital data.<br />
          The shift data is as follows:<br />
          When the data sent to the DAC has been shifted 1 time, SF<sub>0</sub>
          sends "High".<br />
          When the data sent to the DAC has been shifted 2 times, SF<sub>1</sub>
          sends "High".<br />
          When the data sent to the DAC has been shifted 4 times, SF<sub>2</sub>
          sends "High".<br />
          When the data sent to the DAC has been shifted 8 times, SF<sub>3</sub>
          Sends "High".
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Misleading terminology aside, this confirms the functionality of the
          <i>Scale Factor</i> pins and this DAC circuit. The TX7's schematics
          describe this circuit as a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compander" target="_blank"
            ><i>compander</i></a
          >. It's likely that Yamaha's engineers didn't have access to more
          expensive DAC chips capable of the required analog performance, and
          implemented this circuit as a clever cost-saving measure<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_10" id="footnote_10_link">10</a></sup
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the DAC stage, an analog amplifier circuit is used to control
          the final output volume. A lowpass filter with a fixed cutoff
          frequency of 16KHz is then applied to remove spurious high-frequency
          harmonics resulting from the FM synthesis process.

          <b>Decapsulate the YM21280 and YM21290:</b>
          It's likely that this was performed by Yamaha's competitors, if not
          hobbyist reverse engineers, at some point in the past. Aside from Ken
          Shirriff's work, there is no public account of this.
        </p>

          The EGS and OPS chips exist in both plastic, and ceramic packaging.
          The latter of which lends itself much more easily to decapsulation. If
          you happen to have a ceramic version of the YM21290 chip you can
          spare, please get in touch.

          Acreil points out that several of Yamaha's digital pianos, such as the

          YM2603 <i>EGS2</i> chips, the same sound chips used in the DX7ii.
          These chips are likely similar in nature to the YM21280/YM21290 and
          would provide good alternative candidates for IC decapsulation. The

          To fully cover not only the technical details, but the history, would
          take easily a year of research and a series of articles. Despite its
          limited scope, I hope this article has served to entertain and inform
          readers. I hope that it can be of some practical use in future
          reverse-engineering efforts. If you are involved in any such efforts
          and this article was useful, I'd love to hear about your work.

            Multiplication is a comparatively expensive operation relative to
            integer addition, in terms of both clock time on the CPU and die
            size on the LSI chip. Since the DX7's DAC is clocked in at an
            impressive 49096Hz, with 16 6-operator voices each featuring its own
            independent gain, envelope, and feedback operations, this trick

            Prior to the length of the sine table being verified, the brilliant
            synth enthusiast Acreil made the remarkable observation that when
            using a modulator frequency much lower than the carrier, harmonics
            appear in the wave's spectrum corresponding to the length of sine
            table. With a modulator frequency of <i>f</i>, and a full sine
            period of n samples, images of the harmonic appear at <i>n*f</i>. In
            the case of the DX7, <i>n=4096</i>. Interestingly, these harmonics
            become more attenuated as the sine table length increases. This
            factor likely contributes to the trademark gritty
            <i>digital</i> quality of Yamaha's later FM chips, typically having
            much smaller sine tables. <a href="#footnote_6_link">&#8626;</a>

              Generally speaking, the formula for obtaining the phase increment
              for a desired frequency in such a system is:
              <code>&#916;P = N&#8901;(f<sub>mus</sub> / f<sub>sam</sub>)</code
              >. Where N is the size of the phase accumulator (In this case the
              length of the sine table), f<sub>mus</sub> is the musical
              frequency of the note, and f<sub>sam</sub> is the synthesiser's
              sample rate.

              More technical details are known about Yamaha's later FM chips.
              Many of which were mass-produced for use in consumer devices such
              as PC sound-cards, and arcade game consoles. As a result, much
              more documentation on their internal implementation is publicly

              The YM2151 sound chip, for instance, was Yamaha's first
              single-chip FM implementation, and the direct technical successor
              to the YM21280. It contained only four operators, and did not
              require a separate envelope generator chip. Released in 1984
              &#8212;hot on the heels of the DX7&#8212; it would be used in
              Yamaha's four operator FM synthesiser range: the DX21, DX27, and
              DX100. While its design is clearly distinct to that of the chips
              used in the DX7, the <i>YM2151 application manual</i> describes in
              detail the internal registers involved in the calculation of the
              phase increment. Anyone interested should refer to the publicly
              available documentation for the <i>OPM</i>, <i>OPL</i>, and
              <i>OPL2</i> chips. One particularly good resource on programming
              these 4-operator FM chips can be found

            Acreil points out that the increased quantization distortion
            resulting from this setup is neglibile, and is most likely not
            responsible for the DX7's trademark distortion. He notes that the
            source is more likely to be poor resistor matching in the
            compander's resistor ladder, or possibly the <i>settling time</i> of
            the BA9221 DAC being insufficient for the DX7's high sample rate and

              Since the EGS and OPS chips were never intended for use in
              consumer devices, it's not likely that Yamaha ever created any
              official datasheets or programming manuals for them. If such
              documentation <i>did</i> ever exist, then it's unfortunately
              likely to have been lost in the intervening decades.
