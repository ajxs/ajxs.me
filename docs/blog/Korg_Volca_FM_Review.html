          <span class="heading">TL;DR:</span> A fantastic idea, hampered by a
          terrible, short-sighted implementation. The Volca FM amounts to little
          more than an expensive toy. Not cheap enough to be good value, not
          good enough to be valuable. The Volca FM is truly a disappointment
          given KORG's history of creating fantastic synths.
        </div>
        <p>
          It's not often that I get the least bit excited by new synthesizer
          releases. The most modern synth I own, and incidentally the only
          synthesizer in my studio that I purchased outright from a store, is a
          MicroKORG. A synthesizer which is now old enough to vote.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the analog fetishism of my peers proceeded steadily towards the
          boutique territory of eurorack modules, I spent my formative years of
          synthesizer addiction as a student, relegated by my dismal budget to
          the benighted world of second-hand studio equipment. The remainder of
          my equipment had made its way into my hands, in a variety of
          interesting conditions, through the kind of resourcefulness usually
          associated with Eastern Bloc countries under Soviet occupation. I had
          made a habit of keeping a keen eye on auction sites, trading posts and
          pawn shops for the odd bargain. In the intervening years my collection
          of synthesizers has grown to encompass an increasingly obscure array
          of second-hand vintage curiosities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the exciting days of the mid 'two-thousands' I could only dream of
          participating in the blossoming Moog resurgence, getting my grubby
          novice hands on one of DSI's new Evolver synths, or touching the
          beautiful MS20 reissues that so beautifully furnished the tables of
          synth shops, and my dreams. Truly, I had contracted the dreaded
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_buying_disorder#Gear_Acquisition_Syndrome_(G.A.S.)"
            ><i>Gear Acquisition Syndrome</i></a
          >. However, in what was perhaps a fortuitous case of 'The fox and the
          grapes'<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup
          >, my austere budget had cultivated in me a perverse taste for the
          undisputed pariah of the synth world: digital.
        </p>
        <p>
          In what can only be described as the bitter hangover from the late 80s
          halcyon days of FM, the synthesizers that had done so much to define
          an entire era of music<sup><a href="#footnote_2">2</a></sup> roared at
          full throttle into the rubbish heap of history. By the two-thousands
          Yamaha's mass-produced DX series of synthesizers could be purchased
          for a song. In what I would call one of my life's more serendipitous
          moments, an unexpected series of events put me home early from work at
          just the right time to watch the clock ticking on an eBay auction for
          a Yamaha DX7. I walked away the proud and curious owner of a DX7. A
          beautiful love affair blossomed from that day on, played out over the
          airwaves in harsh, metallic tones.
        </p>
        <h2>High hopes</h2>
        <p>
          My initial hope for the Volca FM was to act as a stand-in for the
          time-honored but physically bulky DX7 that was so dear to my heart.
          Which had admittedly spent the last few years languishing in storage,
          freeing up space on the keyboard rack for
          <a href="/blog/Casio_CZ-101_Review">more recent acquisitions</a>. The
          promise of a pocket-size six-operator FM-synthesizer
          patch-compatible<sup><a href="#footnote_3">3</a></sup>
          with Yamaha's flagship FM synth was just too promising for me to
          ignore. I set out to the music store with grand visions in my mind of
          breathing new life into my old DX7 compositions: Re-recording the
          industrial basses of my youth in modern high-fidelity; Metallic FM
          bells ringing out in beautiful clarity; Fantasies of composing
          darkwave on European inter-city trains with this pocket-sized
          battery-powered FM module tucked safely in my suitcase. Maybe these
          lofty aspirations of mine had set me up for a stern disappointment.
          There's one born every minute, I'm told.
        </p>
        <h2>Unboxing</h2>
        <p>
          Unboxing the device itself was a positive experience. I liked the size
          and feel of the device in my hands. I've never been much for novelty
          when it comes to input. At the risk of betraying a lack of imagination
          on my behalf, I'll admit right now that MIDI is perfectly adequate for
          my needs. Having said this, I found the small touch-pad keyboard to be
          a surprisingly fun and engaging novelty. When the thrill of bashing
          out FM bass with my fingertips began to subside I figured it was time
          to attach the device to a computer and get to work. That was where the
          reality of this device's shortcomings came crashing down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first moment of confusion came quickly: The device features no
          velocity sensitivity. By which I not only refer to the device's
          surprisingly novel physical input mechanism, but also to the device's
          MIDI implementation. The device simply does not acknowledge
          <i>NOTE ON</i> signal velocity via MIDI at all. <em>Huh?</em>
          <br />For me, this was an instant dealbreaker. How did this device get
          off the drawing board without implementing one of the most fundamental
          features of the MIDI standard? Apparently, the device
          <i>does</i> support velocity being manually set via the use of MIDI CC
          commands, as specified in the device's MIDI implementation chart<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_4">4</a></sup
          >. This mimics the internal mechanism used by the 'velocity' fader on
          the device's front-panel to set note velocity globally.<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_4">4</a></sup
          >
          All of this begs the question: who is this synth intended for? It's
          also worth noting that the device is limited to a fairly unimpressive
          3 notes of polyphony.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Volca FM's DAC and amplifier sound cheap, but capable. The
          device's output manages to best the circuitry in the original for
          clarity and brightness in the high end, which is not an enormous feat
          given its vintage. The overall quality is not impressive, however. It
          sounds flat and dull overall compared with other modern devices. The
          device's LFO is horribly clicky, even by the standards of DX7's
          notorious envelopes.
        </p>
        <h2>Talking to the outside world</h2>
        <p>
          The device features only a single MIDI input socket. MIDI output, or
          through-routing are not possible on this unit. Dumping SysEx data from
          the device to external storage is not possible. The Volca FM includes
          two 3.5mm mono jacks for the purposes of manually synchronising patch
          data with another Volca FM unit. It however does support the receiving
          of SysEx patch data via the MIDI input port. This begs the question of
          why KORG added two extraneous audio jacks for synchronisation
          purposes, where a single extra MIDI jack would have afforded the
          device complete SysEx I/O functionality<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_5">5</a></sup
          >. From a unit-cost perspective this would surely be a cheaper
          approach, not to mention a reduction in the extra firmware complexity
          required to encode and decode the patch data in KORG's SYRO
          format.<sup><a href="#footnote_6">6</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Korg's listed specifications for the device suggest compatibility with
          the original DX7's patch format<sup><a href="#footnote_3">3</a></sup
          >. While I was able to load my original DX7 patches onto the device
          via SysEx, many of them did not produce sound when loaded. After some
          experimentation it appeared that there is a bug in the implementation
          of the operator envelopes. Altering the envelope values appeared to
          resolve this to some extent. However even with considerable effort I
          was still unable to load many of my DX7 patches. <br />There's also a
          noted bug in the implementation of the LFO's, discussed in detail here
          <a href="#footnote_7">[7]</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Deconstructing the Volca FM for fun and profit</h2>
        <p>
          The device itself is powered by a
          <a
            href="https://www.cypress.com/products/fm4-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4-microcontroller-mcu-families"
            >Cypress FM4</a
          >
          ARM Cortex M4 processor<sup><a href="#footnote_11">11</a></sup
          >. Since the FM's release KORG has issued several minor firmware
          updates, which are transferable to the device in audio format<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_6">6</a></sup
          >
          via the sync input. An extremely skilled engineer by the name of
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZIuJuF6gmjPht6OkFYCBJg"
            >Pajen</a
          >
          was clever enough to use KORG's own tools to decompile the firmware
          blob from KORG's proprietary SYRO<sup
            ><a href="#footnote_6">6</a></sup
          >
          format into a plain ARM binary. In a stroke of luck, it turned out the
          decoded binary output did not feature any encoding or obfuscation.
          This allowed Pajen to reverse-engineer the firmware in IDA to the
          degree that it was actually possible to correct some of the Volca FM's
          outstanding bugs, in addition to extant bugs in other Volca devices.
          Additionally, he was also able to perform the herculean task of
          implementing proper MIDI NOTE ON velocity functionality in the device.
          Sifting through 256kb of unannotated embedded assembler is certainly a
          feat worthy of respect. He has released several unofficial firmware
          updates for the devices. Information on the latest of which can be
          found here:
          <a href="#footnote_8">[8]</a>
          Additional information on the reverse-engineering process can be found
          in this Gearslutz thread:
          <a href="#footnote_9">[9]</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Ordinarily I preach a pragmatic, ascetic philosophy on the nature of
          gear festishism: That a skilled practitioner can produce good
          music<sup><a href="#footnote_10">10</a></sup> on just about any
          terrible gear. This device has perhaps been sent here to test my
          faith. Korg has missed a valuable opportunity to design a series of
          professional, portable devices with serious musical value. I would
          have suggested removing the induction keyboard, step sequencer and
          other gimmicks. Trade in the sync ports for a combination MIDI
          out/thru port, which would maximise compatibility with other devices
          and permit chaining multiple Volca devices together in a standard
          fashion. A dedicated <i>Volca control</i> companion unit featuring a
          keyboard and sequencer could have better fulfilled the need for
          portable control of the Volca series. Ultimately this is a synthesizer
          designed for the small-souled bugman. It's ultimately no more than a
          toy. It's a disappointing waste of a potentially amazing concept by
          KORG. An even bigger disappointment is that this ill-conceived unit
          will contribute to the already burgeoning problem of landfill.
          Destined to rot to our collective societal loss, next to all of the
          other forgotten plastic children's toys.

            From a firmware-development perspective, SysEx is cheap. Much
            cheaper than the encoding/decoding of KORG's proprietary SYRO audio
            format, clearly. The transfer of SysEx patch data does not require
            compliance with any standard. Typically SysEx binary patch data
            represents a direct dump of the in-memory data structures used by
            the device.

            It's worth noting that newer synthesizers are beginning to use newer
            architectures like ARM. I'm more accustomed to peering under the
            hood of Japanese synthesizers and seeing Renesas chipsets
            implementing Hitachi's ubiquitous
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H8_Family"
              ><i>H8</i> architecture</a
            >. Even as late as 2000, KORG was using H8 based CPUs in synths such
            as the MicroKORG. The KORG Kronos even features an Intel
            motherboard, in addition to an ARM processor, <i>and</i> an H8
            processor. Additionally, firmware updates being distributed in the
            form of binary downloads, rather than EPROM, makes
            reverse-engineering of firmware much easier to accomplish using
            easily accessible tools. It's also worth noting the absence of
            dedicated DSP hardware in these synthesizers.
