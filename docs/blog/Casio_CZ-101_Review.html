	A novel digital synthesizer capable of creating the kind of beautiful bells and squeaky basses
	characteristic of 80s digital synths, and not much else. A nice, fun unit if you can pick it up cheaply in good
	condition. However it compares unfavourably with Yamaha's contemporary FM offerings.</div>

<h2>Initial impressions</h2>
<p>
	I won't try to make any imprudent apples-to-oranges comparisons here to contemporary analog or to modern
	virtual-analog synthesizers. That's certainly not the kind of animal we're dealing with. Casio's CZ-101 is something
	entirely different. For all its strengths, the CZ-101 is certainly no candidate for "desert island synth". Not unlike
	an FM synthesizer, it excels in sounds of a particular, characteristically metallic timbre. A trait it shares with
	most of its digital contemporaries, such as Yamaha's DX series. I was not naive in this regard, having had experience
	with the afforementioned FM synthesisers. I got more or less what I had expected. Your mileage my vary, caveat emptor.
</p>
<p>
	The initial impressions left on me unboxing the device (lovingly packaged in a handy wooden case for me by its
	previous
	owner) were not particularly glowing: Its construction is characteristic of Casio's (perhaps unfair) reputation for
	cheap, plastic equipment<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup>. The device requires 5 D-size batteries for the retention of patch memory and it has only a
	single monophonic line-out socket. The keys have a particularly flimsy quality to them, and are not velocity
	sensitive<sup><a href="#footnote_2">2</a></sup>.
	The device has a fairly wide non-backlit LCD screen, which is great by 80s standards.
</p>
<p>
	The editing interface is clean and straightforward, despite its heavy reliance on paging and scrolling. Editing is
	facilitated by several rows of plastic buttons, which make for a much nicer tactile experience than the Yamaha's DX
	series' nightmarish signature membrane buttons. For a synth of its kind, patch editing is deceptively straightforward.
	This synth manages to sidestep the steep learning curve characteristic of Yamaha's FM synths through both creative
	interface design, and the device's cleverly simplified implementation of Phase Distortion synthesis<sup><a href="#footnote_3">3</a></sup>.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
	Diving into the synth engine itself, I was pleasantly surprised by its capabilities. For all it lacks in flair, the
	synth includes some surprisingly sophisticated features. The ability to control not just the level, but the slope of
	each segment in the <i>8-stage</i> oscillator, waveshaper and amplitude envelopes for each timbre was a pleasant surprise. If
	you paid attention in that last sentence you'd notice that I not only indicated that it has separate 8-stage envelopes
	for each feature (eight!), but I also said <i>slope</i>. Unlike what has become the de-facto standard in ADSR envelopes,
	you're not controlling the time of each envelope segment but its slope. This subtle feature caught me by surprise when I was
	wondering why a value of 48 in the 'rate' field provided a steady, linear increase in volume, while a value of 36 was
	grindingly slow. I initially suspected there exists some kind of configurable exponential slope to the envelope until
	consulting the manual. Another unexpectedly nice feature is the ability to control which of the 8 segments functions
	as
	the sustain and release segments. This feature, in effect, allows you to use only the number of segments you need in a
	sound. Very cool.
</p>
<p>
	As mentioned, the CZ-101 uses <i>Phase Distortion synthesis</i>. As a result the synth doesn't have filters. Instead it
	features waveshapers for each of the synth's two timbres. Phase distortion synthesis functions by modulating the phase
	angle of a sine wave stored in ROM memory to introduce harmonic changes in the sound. A great, simple explanation of
	the process can be found here: <a href="#footnote_4">[4]</a>.
	One illustative example of this process is increasing the phase angle of the rising edge of the sine wave, while
	decreasing the phase angle of the falling edge. This distorts a sinusoidal wave into a sawtooth like form. Through
	this process the CZ-101 is able to construct an array of novel waveforms. The manual provides some insight into this
	process, complete with useful diagrams. The waveshapers, and their accompanying envelopers, seem to adjust the intensity of
	this distortion. Higher settings pushing the sine waves much further towards sawtooth waves, increasing the frequency as a
	consequence. The effect, while entirely foreign in theory, is not too unlike that of a VCF in practice and is able to
	create familiar sounds with some small effort.
</p>
<p>
	Among its other features are a ring modulator capable of creating seriously harsh tones, and a very flexible key
	tracking facility for the oscillator, waveshaper and amp sections. One interesting feature is the ability to use
	either the second timbre to ring modulate the first, or use the first timbre to modulate itself. Aside from its very generous
	envelopes, the synth offers very little in terms of modulation. However this is standard among 80s digital synths.
	Apparently, according to this very interesting website: <a href="#footnote_6">[6]</a> there are some hidden features on the synth accessible
	only by SysEx. It's certainly worth a look!
</p>

<h2>Sound</h2>
<p>
	Depending on what you're trying to create, it's not hard to spin up interesting sounds from scratch on the CZ-101.
	Again, tending towards the usual percussive bell sounds common which defined the music of the 80s. The presets are
	exactly what you'd expect. Ghastly strings, bright brassy sawsâ€¦ And the particularly evocative 'Fairy Tale' patch
	famously used by Burzum<sup><a href="#footnote_5">5</a></sup>. For what it's worth, the process of getting a usable patch from scratch is much easier than
	on an FM synthesizer. It is worth noting, however, that the CZ-101 does not ship with a usable initialised patch in the
	empty internal storage slots.
</p>

<p>
	The sound of the synthesizer is what you'd expect from a budget digital unit. The output is quite flat and muted.
	However it's nothing so severe that post-processing with EQ and an exciter can't clean it up nicely. It didn't take
	long
	for me to create dark and brooding metallic pads that really pulled me with their striking, harsh tones. The unit is
	definitely rough around the edges, but without any doubt it's capable of impressive sounds.
</p>

<h2> So I'm convinced, where do I sign up?</h2>
<p>
	These synths don't appear to be particularly common, nor entirely rare. They've achieved a well-deserved cult status
	for reasons that this blog post will attest to. The Australian synth market suffers from highly inflated prices, so I
	can't testify as to their affordability where you may be. I overpaid for the novelty of mine, however I hear that those in
	theUS are able to pick these things for bargain prices. I found mine on eBay, however they're regular features on Reverb
	and trading post pages like Gumtree (If you live in Australia like I do).
	I can't speak for the CZ-3000 and CZ-5000 personally, however all evidence seems to suggest that Casio improved
	considerably upon the design of the CZ-101 in the later models in the series.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	This synth certainly features an engine designed by intelligent, forward thinking engineers who had a genuine,
	inspired idea to explore. It was seemingly then belted and bashed into a budget unit fit for the hobbyist market<sup><a href="#footnote_7">7</a></sup>. It's not a
	good quality instrument by any means, however it's an absolutely great novelty digital synth capable of fantastic,
	beautiful bell sounds and harsh digital noise.
</p>
<p>
	The CZ-101 is a novel digital synthesizer capable of creating the kind of beautiful bells and squeaky basses
	characteristic of 80s digital synths. However it doesn't excel at much else. It's a nice, fun unit if you can pick one
	up for a bargain price in good condition. However the it compares unfavourably with Yamaha's contemporary FM
	offerings,
	which are not only capable of more versatile synthesis but are of a much higher quality overall. For not much more of
	an
	investment, one could pick up an actual DX7.
</p>

<p>
	If you're a fan of 80s digital like I am, jump on in. This is a fun synth capable of uniquely alien sounds. If you're
	a beginner to the synth world looking for somewhere to begin, my advice is look elsewhere. A more well-rounded synth can
	be found more cheaply and easily elsewhere.
