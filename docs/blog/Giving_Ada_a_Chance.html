		<span class="heading">TL;DR:</span>
		Ada is an interesting and robust programming language that has a lot to offer modern developers of system and bare-metal software. 
		At very least, Ada presents many interesting ideas that designers of modern programming languages could stand to learn much from. 
		If you want a 30-second version of this article, 
		check out the <a href="#practical_example" target="_blank">practical example</a> that I provide for a comparison of Ada with C.

		<span class="heading">Update October 2022:</span>
		After receiving some fantastic correspondence from experienced Ada developers,
		I've made some amendments to this article to correct some factual errors, remove some unsubstantiated conjecture,
		and improve the general quality of the writing.

	<p>
		By no deliberate design of my own, I happen to live close to a university. 
		Not in the kind of 'University town' common to much of Europe or the United States, 
		but in the densely packed suburban sprawl of Sydney's inner-city. 
		Making my way home one serendipitous afternoon, 
		I happened across a sizeable stack of books sitting on the curb outside the aforementioned University's engineering buildings. 
		The university was in the process of liquidating its stockpile of old engineering books, 
		and had left them in a pile for the local council to collect. 
		Sifting through the pile for anything interesting, 
		two books in caught my eye: <i>Building Parallel, Embedded, and Real-Time Applications with Ada</i>, 
		and <i>Concurrent and Real-Time Programming in Ada</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'd heard of Ada before.
		I understood that it came from a pedigree of languages developed for the United States military, 
		and that it still occupied a niche in the development of safety-critical applications,
		but that was about all I knew.
		Curious, I threw the books in my bag and off I went.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="exceeding_my_expectations">Exceeding My Expectations <a class="permalink" href="#exceeding_my_expectations">#</a></h2>
	<p>
		Admittedly, I had pictured Ada's syntax resembling the uncompromising verbosity and rigid construction of COBOL, 
		or perhaps the Lovecraftian hieroglyphics of APL's various eldritch incarnations. 
		Turning the pages, 
		I was pleasantly surprised to see modern constructs associated with modern high-level languages such as ranges, 
		slicing, and exception-handling.
		The syntax &#8212;admittedly verbose by modern standards<sup><a href="#footnote_1" id="footnote_1_link">1</a></sup>&#8212; 
		seemed carefully constructed to make the language comprehensible at a glance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fact that Ada was designed with embedded software in mind had me interested. 
		I already had some limited experience with bare-metal development on the x86 and ARM platforms using C and assembly, 
		so the prospect of using higher-level constructs on bare-metal had me intrigued.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="not_the_camel_you_expected">Not the Camel You Expected <a class="permalink" href="#not_the_camel_you_expected">#</a></h2>
	<p>
		A common criticism of Ada is that it's a language 'designed by committee',
		or even worse, a language 'designed by committee <em>for the military</em>'<sup><a href="#footnote_2" id="footnote_2_link">2</a></sup>. 
		The implication being that this would preclude it from having any kind of <em>real-world</em> practicality<sup><a href="#footnote_3" id="footnote_3_link">3</a></sup>. 
		I'll spare readers a detailed retelling of Ada's conception within the Department of Defense's 
		<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/pol-hist/history/holwg-93/holwg-93.htm" target="_blank">'High Order Language Working Group'</a> (HOLWG), 
		save to say that Ada was born of the need for single, 
		unified higher-level language suitable for use in the multitude of real-time embedded systems developed by the DoD<sup><a href="#footnote_4" id="footnote_4_link">4</a></sup>. 
		In the wise words of the working-group's chair, Colonel William A. Whitaker: 
		<i>'It was concluded that no existing language could be adopted as a single common high order language for the DoD, 
		but that a single language meeting essentially all the requirements was both feasible and desirable'</i>. 
		If such a thing was indeed feasible, the DoD's deep pockets would help it bring it into existence. 

		Bell Labs were invited to evaluate the C programming language against the DoD requirements,
		however (In the words of the HOLWG)
		<i>'...they said that there was no chance of C meeting the requirements of readability, safety, etc.'</i> (Whitaker, 1993). 
	</p>
	<p>
		In what would prove a controversial decision, 
		the DoD would go so far as to mandate the use of Ada for <em>all</em> in-house software engineering.
	</p>

	<h2 id="what_makes_it_so_good">So What Makes It Special? <a class="permalink" href="#what_makes_it_so_good">#</a></h2>
	<p>
		Ada has many useful features that are of particular interest for low-level programming.
		I'll go over a few of my favourite features below.
	</p>

	<h3>Custom Types</h3>
	<p>
		In addition to being a strongly typed language, 
		Ada allows for the definition of new scalar, enumerated, and record types (the equivalent of structures in C).
		Custom primitive types can also be constrained to a predefined range of values.
	</p>
	<p>
		The example below demonstrates the definition of a new integer type based upon Ada's native <code>Natural</code> type,
		restricted to a predefined range.
		The use of the subtype directive informs the compiler that other variables of the <code>Natural</code> type are compatible with the newly defined subtype.
	</p>

	<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="no">VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kr">constant</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="mi">80</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="no">VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kr">constant</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">subtype</span> <span class="kt">Col</span> <span class="kr">is</span> <span class="kt">Natural</span> <span class="kr">range</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">..</span> <span class="n">VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">subtype</span> <span class="kt">Row</span> <span class="kr">is</span> <span class="kt">Natural</span> <span class="kr">range</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">..</span> <span class="n">VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>

	<p>
		The below example illustrates the creation of incompatible custom integer types. 
		While their base type and range constraints are identical, Ada treats both as separate, incompatible types. 
		An assignment of a variable of one type to the value of another is illegal, and will trigger a compile-time error.
	</p>

	<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="kt">Integer_1</span> <span class="kr">is</span> <span class="kr">range</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">..</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">type</span> <span class="kt">Integer_2</span> <span class="kr">is</span> <span class="kr">range</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">..</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">A</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Integer_1</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">B</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Integer_2</span> <span class="p">:=</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">-- illegal!</span>
</pre></div>

	<p>
		The following example demonstrates the creation of a custom enumerated type. 
		It also demonstrates a subtype of an enumerated type with a constrained range of values.
	</p>

	<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="kt">Day_Of_Week</span> <span class="kr">is</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">Monday</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">Tuesday</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nv">Wednesday</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">Thursday</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">Friday</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">Saturday</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">Sunday</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">subtype</span> <span class="kt">Work_Day</span> <span class="kr">is</span> <span class="n">Day_Of_Week</span> <span class="kr">range</span> <span class="n">Monday</span> <span class="p">..</span> <span class="n">Friday</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>

	<p>
		A variable with the type of <code>Work_Day</code> is restricted to its constrained range. 
		Any attempt to assign a value outside this range to a variable of this type will raise a <code>Constraint_Error</code> exception at runtime.
	</p>

	<h3>Representation Clauses</h3>
	<p>
		One feature that particularly impressed me is Ada's <i>representation clauses</i>. 
		They provide a construct for defining the in-memory representation of a type. 
		I could immediately see how I could use this feature in my own long-suffering operating system projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following example demonstrates the definition of a record type, 
		as well as its associated representation in memory.
	</p>
	
	<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="c1">--  The format of the System Table Descriptor pointer used by the processor</span>
<span class="c1">--  to load descriptor tables like the GDT and IDT.</span>
<span class="c1">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="kd">type</span> <span class="kt">System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span class="kr">is</span> <span class="kr">record</span>
   <span class="n">Size</span>   <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Unsigned_16</span><span class="p">;</span>
   <span class="n">Offset</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">System</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kt">Address</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kr">end record</span>
<span class="kr">with</span> <span class="n">Size</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">48</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kr">for</span> <span class="n">System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span class="kn">use</span> <span class="n">record</span>
  <span class="n">Size</span>   <span class="kr">at</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="kr">range</span> <span class="mi">0</span>  <span class="p">..</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">Offset</span> <span class="kr">at</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="kr">range</span> <span class="mi">16</span> <span class="p">..</span> <span class="mi">47</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kr">end</span> <span class="kr">record</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>

	<p>
		The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>System_Table_Descriptor</code> type must be 48 bits in size. 
		The record representation clause instructs the compiler as to the required layout of this record type in memory. 
		This example specifies that the <code>Size</code> member should occupy bits 0 to 15, 
		and the <code>Offset</code> member should occupy bits 16 to 47. 
		This feature is analogous to C's bit-fields. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The following example demonstrates defining the in-memory representation of an enumerated type.
	</p>
	
	<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="c1">--  The privilege level for a particular descriptor.</span>
<span class="c1">--  These correspond to the 'protection ring' that this descriptor is</span>
<span class="c1">--  accessible from.</span>
<span class="c1">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="kd">type</span> <span class="kt">Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span class="kr">is</span> <span class="p">(</span>
   <span class="nv">Ring_0</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="nv">Ring_1</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="nv">Ring_2</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="nv">Ring_3</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
<span class="kr">with</span> <span class="n">Size</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kr">for</span> <span class="n">Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span class="kn">use</span> <span class="p">(</span>
   <span class="n">Ring_0</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="n">Ring_1</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="n">Ring_2</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="n">Ring_3</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

	<p>
		The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</code> type must be 2 bits in size.
		The representation clause instructs the compiler as to required representation of each possible value of the enumerated type in memory. 
		In this example the value of <code>Ring_0</code> will be represented by a value of <code>0x0</code> in memory,
		the value of <code>Ring_1</code> will be represented by <code>0x1</code>, and so on.
	</p>

		Contrast this with the same functionality implemented in C. 
		Despite being shorter, the register cannot be altered without using bitwise operators to manipulate the individual fields.
		This approach is generally considered more error-prone than using a record in Ada overlaid at the register's memory-mapped address.
		It's possible to define a struct type in C with bit-fields for the individual elements, 
		however the C standard does not guarantee the layout and order of the individual fields<sup><a href="#footnote_5" id="footnote_5_link">5</a></sup>.

	<h2 id="the_bad">The Bad and the Ugly <a class="permalink" href="#the_bad">#</a></h2>
	<p>
		No programming language is perfect, and Ada is no exception.
		I freely admit that I'm by no means an expert in Ada,
		so some of these (minor) complaints might be explained by my naivet&#233; of established conventions and inexperience with the language.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Poor pointer semantics</b> - The requirement to declare a pointer-to-type as a new type feels especially onerous.
		Declaring a distinct pointer type may be intuitive to the compiler, 
		but it provides an unnecessary burden to the programmer. 
		Conversion to and from &#8212;and subsequent dereferencing of&#8212; pointers is unnecessarily cumbersome. 
		Needing to instantiate the generic library 
		<a href="https://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/standards/05rm/html/RM-13-7-2.html" target="_blank"><code>Address_To_Access_Conversions</code></a> 
		to do something as simple as creating a pointer from an arbitrary address seems like unnecessary overkill.
		That being said, I like the semantic intuitiveness of Ada's <i>access types</i>,
		they point to a memory address, and allow <i>access</i> to the value located there. 
		The noted absence of pointer arithmetic is very welcome: <i>Access types</i> in Ada are not a numeric type in any form.
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps these minor inconveniences are simply unavoidable consequences of integrating a low-level concept like pointers into higher-level language constructs. 
		Despite the presence of many higher-level constructs such as ranges, fat-pointers and object-orientation, 
		Ada is principally oriented around low-level concerns, which is a perfect segue into my second issue&#8230;
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>The runtime</b> - In addition to implementing Ada's standard library, 
		the runtime has a wide scope of responsibilities,
		such as performing range checks on constrained types.
		Comprehensive knowledge of the Ada runtime and its structure is required to implement even moderately high-level language constructs for a new platform.
	</p>
	<p>
		My compiler didn't ship with a suitable <i>zero-footprint</i> runtime library for the x86 platform. 
		As a result I had to implement my own 'zero-footprint' runtime library. 
		I found the process to be particularly unintuitive. 
		The equivalent process of putting together the build pipeline and infrastructure for a bare-metal C environment is much more straightforward.
		The ability to make highly granular modifications to the language's runtime is extremely useful if you're targeting platforms with limited resources or functionality.
		However the complicated nature of this process serves as a barrier to uptake that other languages may not have. 
		This is by no means an insurmountable problem, 
		just something I found particularly confusing as a newcomer.
	</p>
	<p>
		I put together a comprehensive guide to setting up an Ada runtime library suitable for operating system development on the x86 platform, 
		which can be viewed <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Ada_Runtime_Library" target="_blank">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite some minor misgivings, my experience with Ada remains positive overall. 
		More than once I've heard online detractors accuse Ada of having aged poorly, 
		or excuse it on the basis that it's a product of its time; 
		A historical artefact to be taken as-is, not to be judged by today's &#8212;presumably higher&#8212; standards.
		The fact that many of the high-level language constructs found in modern scripting languages have been in Ada since the beginning
		shows that maybe <em>the rest</em> of the programming ecosystem hasn't actually aged as well as we think.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="what_happened">What Happened? <a class="permalink" href="#what_happened">#</a></h2>
	<p>
		Despite having a lot to offer, 
		Ada never gained much ground as a mainstream programming language outside the aerospace and defense industries.
		Many explanations have been offered as to why,
		with language historians often citing Ada's early compiler ecosystem as a barrier for the language's wider adoption.
		Veterans of the DoD's Ada mandate trade 
		<a href="http://www.somethinkodd.com/oddthinking/category/geek/software-development/rat1000/" target="_blank">war stories</a>
		about long compilation times on expensive, proprietary development infrastructure.
		The technical challenge of implementing, 
		and operating an Ada compiler on contemporary hardware was so significant that enterprise software tool developer Rational would even go so far as creating a dedicated workstation for the task, 
		the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_R1000" target="_blank">Rational R1000</a><sup><a href="#footnote_6" id="footnote_6_link">6</a></sup>.
		Even with the Ada standard being publicly available,
		It wouldn't be until the release of <i>GNAT</i> in 1995 &#8212;based on the FSF's GCC compiler&#8212; that Ada would have a freely available compiler.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite Department of Defense sponsored studies acknowledging Ada as the most suitable language for the task (National Research Council, 1997),
		the DoD would ultimately 
		<a href="https://www.adahome.com/articles/1997-04/po_memopaige.html" target="_blank">repeal</a>
		its controversial mandate<sup><a href="#footnote_7" id="footnote_7_link">7</a></sup> that all in-house mission-critical software be developed in Ada.
		By this point in time the DoD had largely shifted its focus away from sponsoring expensive in-house software development, 
		and towards the utilisation of 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf" target="_blank"><i>COTS</i></a> (Commercial Off The Shelf) software.
		This event would mark the beginning of Ada's decline in the general programming community.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the development of the benighted F-35 Joint Strike Fighter's avionics software, 
		Lockheed Martin would ultimately choose to forgo Ada in lieu a heavily abridged dialect of C++<sup><a href="#footnote_8" id="footnote_8_link">8</a></sup>.
		John H. Robb, the Senior Manager of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Air Vehicle Software team at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Fort Worth 
		<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111219004314/http://journal.thedacs.com:80/issue/53/158" target="_blank">writes on the subject</a>:
		<i>'Ada was seen as the technically superior and more robust language, 
		but concern over the ability to successfully staff the software engineers required to develop the massive amounts of 
		safety critical software caused the F-35 team to carefully look and finally to choose C and C++ for the implementation of safety critical software.'</i> 
		For Ada fans this statement is bittersweet indeed.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="whats_next">What's Next, and What Have We Learned? <a class="permalink" href="#whats_next">#</a></h2>
	<p>
		For all the water-cooler chatter of obsolescence, Ada still enjoys serious respect in industries where failure isn't an option. 
		Nvidia <a href="https://www.adacore.com/company/partners/nvidia" target="_blank">recently</a> chose Ada and its SPARK subset<sup><a href="#footnote_9" id="footnote_9_link">9</a></sup> 
		as their language of choice for developing safety-critical firmware in their embedded-systems.
		Some other notable users of Ada include the European Space Agency<sup><a href="#footnote_10" id="footnote_10_link">10</a></sup>, 
		BAE Systems, Saab, Thales, and <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/projects/atwork/boeing.html" target="_blank">Boeing</a>.
		A quick glance at leading Ada compiler manufacturer AdaCore's 
		<a href="https://www.adacore.com/company/our-customers" target="_blank">customer list</a> 
		demonstrates that the market for Ada is certainly alive and well.
		The historical record will likely prove kinder to Ada than its critics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many developers point to Rust as the systems programming language of the future. 
		Rust markets itself as a <i>safe</i><sup><a href="#footnote_11" id="footnote_11_link">11</a></sup> language, 
		which invites comparisons against both C and Ada (for vastly different reasons). 
		Superficial comparisons aside, 
		Rust seems like a language that has neither learned much from C's failures, nor from Ada's successes. 
		Despite what the Rust community may say &#8212;or the algal bloom of new OSdev projects in Rust&#8212; 
		Rust does not seem well adapted to low-level programming:
		It lacks basic features like bitfields, and data structure packing. 
		Its foreign function interface seems particularly poorly implemented. 
		The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html" target="_blank">official Rust documentation</a> 
		suggests the use of the external third-party <code>libc</code> library (called a <i>'crate'</i> in Rust parlance)
		to provide the type definitions necessary to interface with C programs. 
		As of the time of writing, this crate has had 
		<a href="https://crates.io/crates/libc/versions" target="_blank">95 releases</a><sup><a href="#footnote_12" id="footnote_12_link">12</a></sup>.
		Contrast this with Ada's <code>Interfaces.C</code> package, 
		which was added the language in Ada 95 and hasn't needed to change in any fundamental way since.
		Despite Rust's present shortcomings, 
		it could prove to be a capable language that has much to offer if it can manage to standardise itself and evolve in a sensible way<sup><a href="#footnote_13" id="footnote_13_link">13</a></sup>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I'm nothing if not an idealist, for better or worse.
		I've been willing to pick for myself the smallest hills to die on in matters of technical dispute. 
		When push comes to shove however, it pays to be pragmatic.
		It's true of course that any fully-featured systems programming language can be utilised in a safety-critical manner. 
		As John H. Robb himself so eloquently notes in the aforementioned article: 
		<i>'&#8230;the basic elements required to make a language work in [the safety-critical] domain are persistence, 
		determination, and good software engineering discipline'</i>. 
		This is of course true, however the qualities he mentions are valuable commodities indeed.
		If persistence, determination, and discipline are to be requirements, 
		why not choose a language that requires less of them to achieve the same high-quality results?
		After all, software is certainly easier to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm" target="_blank">get</a>
		<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3568" target="_blank">wrong</a> than it is to get right.
