		<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	My name is Anthony, I'm a senior software engineer with experience working across 
	the entire tech stack: from bare-metal development targeting embedded systems, to 
	full-stack web development on modern platforms.
</p>
<p>
	I have significant experience working on mission-critical applications in the fintech sector, 
	including integration with payment processors. I am highly experienced working with
	cloud platform providers such as AWS, including the development, and maintenance of
	both monolithic, and microservice-based cloud applications targeting these platforms.
</p>
<p>
	I also have experience developing, and maintaining serverless applications deployed
	on cloud platforms.
</p>
<p>
	I am passionate about developing robust and extensible solutions, with an interest 
	in static analysis for creating sturdy, bug-free applications.
</p>
<p>
	I have a passion for technical writing, and I am 
	an <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/User:Ajxs">occasional contributor</a> to the Operating System
	development wiki at <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page">osdev.org</a>, 
	as well as an indepedent technical writer.
</p>
<p>
	I am available to hire for reverse-engineering projects. I'm particularly interested in synthesiser firmware,
	or retro computing systems. Please email me to discuss price, and availability.
</p>
<p>
	My CV is available upon request.
